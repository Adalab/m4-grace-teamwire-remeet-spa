# Adalab Talent Week - Teamwire Project

Teamwire, is a fast, intuitive and secure business messaging company, which has its employees relocated to various parts of Europe. Different face-to-face meetings are held every year to coordinate teams and product objectives.

For this reason, an application is needed in which all employees are registered indicating their reference airport. On the other hand, there will also be the different offices or places that are being considered to hold a meeting.
When the user uses the application, he must enter a meeting start date and another end date. The application must return the ordered list of places where it is cheaper to make the meeting.
